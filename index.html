      <p>
        Former psychology and philosophy graduate from New York University who
        loves teaching and video games. I am a nerd who became interested in
        programming through my interest in social psychology and my love of video
        games. I attended the fullstack web development course at Flatiron School,
        where I learned sql, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and React.js.
        I am always trying to learn new technologies, and am a writer for two
        Publishers on Medium, where I write articles detailing how to use the new
        technologies and tools as I learn them. I have also been a private tutor
        for many years, and am currently a part-time teaching assistant and grader at Trilogy
        Education and at Generation USA for full-stack web development bootcamp courses. I enjoy making
        video game related projects in my spare time. Feel free to contact me!

        <a href="https://league-of-cards-app.herokuapp.com/">Play League of Cards</a>
        <h3>Fanmade card game featuring characters from League of Legends where you get cards, create decks, and fight a computer.</h3>
        <p>- Utilized Rails/PostgreSQL API backend to create a relational database between cards, decks, and accounts</p>
        <p>- React frontend dynamically displays changes to background, text, cards, and field in response to user input</p>
        <p>- Redux frontend to store user account information so different aspects can be easily accessed, displayed, and modified as needed by various components as the player interacts with them</p>
        <p>- Functional AI that will make the optimal moves each turn by taking into consideration the current state of the AI and player field, the AI hand, and any potential combos</p>

      <h2>Granblue Fantasy Gacha Simulator <img class="icon" src="images/granblue_fantasy_icon.jpg" /></h2>
        <a href="https://gbf-gacha.herokuapp.com/">Test Granblue Fantasy Gacha Simulator</a>
        <h3>A simulator for rolling on the gacha machine for the popular browser/mobile game Granblue Fantasy.</h3>
        <p>- Restructured backend API to use Node.js/MongoDB from Rails and PostgreSQL since database only consists of simple objects with no relations to each other</p>
        <p>- React frontend to activate a roll and cycle through results when corresponding buttons are clicked</p>
        <p>- Employed Redux to store currency and results from rolls in global state so they can be displayed, and updated by several several different components without having to pass props</p>

      <h2>Mobile Blackjack <img class="icon" src="images/playing_cards_icon.png" /></h2>
        <h3>Blackjack vs AI for iOS.</h3>
        <p>- ReactNative used since card games are simple, lightweight, and often played as a distraction on handheld devices </p>
        <p>- Display cards on the field and in both players hands, as well as dynamically updates based on player and AI moves</p>
        <p>- AI makes moves based on dealer rules and the player’s visible cards while preferring a safe approach</p>
